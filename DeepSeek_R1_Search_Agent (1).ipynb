The user wants information gathered from specific Bitcoin-related websites, so I need to use the provided tools—search and scrape—to collect data from those sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, since there are no existing memory blocks, I need to start fresh. The task is to determine what happens when mixing SIGHASH flags. I recall that SIGHASH flags determine which parts of a transaction are signed by the input's signature. Mixing them might have implications for transaction validity, security, or flexibility. But I need concrete information from the listed websites.\n",
            "\n",
            "My first step should be to use the search tool with a query targeting the specific question. Let's try searching for \"sighash flags mixing Bitcoin transaction\" on the available Bitcoin sites. Since the user listed sites like bitcoinops.org, bitcointalk.org, and btctranscripts.com, I should focus there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assuming the search tool will return relevant pages from these domains. For example, Bitcoinops.org has technical documentation and might explain SIGHASH combinations. Similarly, btctranscripts.com might have transcripts from conferences where developers discussed this. Delvingbitcoin.org and scalingbitcoin.org/transcripts are also good candidates for technical discussions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but how does the search tool work? Does it search across all the listed websites, or do I need to pick one? The example given in the tools section shows just a search query input without specifying URLs, so maybe the search tool is searching within the provided websites. Alternatively, maybe it's a generic web search restricted to those domains. The user mentions \"using only bitcoin specific websites like provided below,\" so I need to ensure queries target those sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, for the first tool call using \"search\", input could be \"mix SIGHASH flags bitcoin site:bitcoinops.org\" or similar commands to search within those domains. But does the tool handle site-specific searches? The example shows a straightforward query like \"renewable energy statistics 2023\", so perhaps I need to structure the search input to include site-specific syntax. For example, \"site:bitcoinops.org mixing sighash flags\" to search within bitcoinops.org. Similarly for other sites.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the initial tool calls, maybe start with a broad search across the listed sites. Since the user allowed other sources only as a last resort if the provided ones don't have info, but first prioritize the listed ones. So the first search input might be something like:\n",
            "\n",
            "\"mixing sighash flags Bitcoin transaction site:bitcoinops.org OR site:btctranscripts.com OR site:delvingbitcoin.org OR site:scalingbitcoin.org/transcripts\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe multiple separate searches? But per the guidelines, maximum 3 tool calls per round. So perhaps start with three different search queries targeting different domains.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, use \"search\" with a query that includes the keywords and the sites. Let me check:\n",
            "\n",
            "The first tool call could be a search for \"what happens when mixing SIGHASH flags Bitcoin\" restricting to the given sites. Wait, but how to structure that. For example, to search within multiple sites using Google's syntax, you can use \"OR site:example.com\". So combining the sites with OR operators. But perhaps within the tool's context, the search is tailored to the provided URLs automatically. The user's note says \"Potential Websites(you may any other source if no relevant concrete info is found as last resort)\", so maybe the search tool is set up to prioritize those URLs first.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe the agent should assume the search queries will retrieve results from the listed websites. So for the initial searches, use the search tool with queries like \"mixing sighash flags\" and expect the tool to fetch from sites like bitcoinops.org, btctranscripts.com, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, once the search returns relevant URLs, the agent can use the scrape tool on those URLs to get detailed info.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the plan:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Use the search tool with input \"mixing SIGHASH flags bitcoin transaction\" to find relevant pages on the listed sites. Save any URLs found as memory blocks.\n",
            "2. Search again with a slightly different query perhaps targeting technical aspects: \"effects of combining SIGHASH flags in Bitcoin\".\n",
            "3. Maybe a third search query like \"SIGHASH_ALL SIGHASH_SINGLE mixed\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Then scrape the returned URLs in subsequent rounds if search finds any.\n",
            "\n",
            "But since this is the first cycle, tool_results are empty. So in the first response, make search tool calls.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, each search call would return results from the tool (a list of URLs?), then you process them and add to memory. Then in the next cycle, you can scrape them.\n",
            "\n",
            "But given the initial setup, here's how the agent should proceed:\n",
            "\n",
            "First, decide which search queries to run.\n",

            "\n",
            "But given that each tool call is a separate query, and the search tool might aggregate results from multiple sites. Wait, maybe using the site: operator in the search query can focus on specific domains. Alternatively, the tool's search is configured to only include the listed domains.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assuming that the agent formulates search queries that target the listed domains using the site: operator. So mixing different site parameters across the three tool calls to cover multiple sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "Example:\n",

            "\n",
            "3. Search \"sighash combination\" on delvingbitcoin.org: input \"sighash combination site:delvingbitcoin.org\"\n",
            "\n",
            "These three search tool calls would query each of the major domains for relevant information.\n",
            "\n",
            "After these searches, whatever URLs are found would be added to the memory as blocks, then in the next cycle, the agent can scrape them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the scrape results come in, extract relevant info about mixing SIGHASH flags.\n",
            "\n",
            "But for now, since we have no prior tool results, the first step is to generate three search queries covering the relevant sites, add the found URLs as memory blocks, and proceed.\n",
            "\n",
            "So the first JSON response would include three search tool calls, and memory additions for each URL found (but since we haven't seen the results yet, perhaps the agent cannot create memory blocks yet).\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, no: the tool_results are empty now, so after generating the search calls, the next step (when the tool results come back) will process them and add URLs/memory blocks. Therefore, in the initial cycle, the agent can only propose the tool calls, then in subsequent cycles, process the results.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, the first JSON should contain three search queries targeting the specific sites.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the search tool executes, returns URLs, those can be processed and added to memory, then scraped.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to stick strictly to the user's scenario here, since the user provided the initial empty workspace and no tool results, the agent needs to generate search tool calls.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the first step would involve making strategic search queries to collect initial URLs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, in the next iteration, those search results would yield URLs, which can be scraped.\n",

            "\n",
            "But it's possible that some of the searches might not return relevant results, but we have to start somewhere.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, finalizing the tool calls:\n",

Either you have to use one of the really common script setups, so you're either doing singlesig or maybe you're doing two of three or a small number of people do three or five, or you end up standing out like a sore thumb because if you build some really interesting time decaying multisig or if you end up building some really exotic 13 of 15 multisig because that's what makes sense for you as an individual or an organization, then that ends up being very identifiable on-chain because nobody is doing it. So another thing that's nice about Bitcoin is that it's pseudonymous and ideally just spending your bitcoins doesn't immediately identify you on-chain.

That's like the foundational one. That's the bottom of everything, right? We can also compare values. One of the value comparisons that's really useful is you put a hash into your script, and then you provide in the script witness a value, and you say, does this value I provided hash to the same thing that I committed to in my script? And that's called a hash lock. We can also do time locks where we say, is the current block later than the current block height, or has so many blocks passed by? And those are time locks. And we can combine these things together and compose them together. And one of the things that's cool is that Bitcoin script, especially in a post-Taproot world if you compose a script and you say, I want these coins to be spendable.

Like we used to have nonce problems with just normal single-sig Bitcoin before, and then we standardized on using deterministic nonces. In multi-party signature aggregation protocols, you don't want to use deterministic nonces. Instead, you want to pre-commit to them ahead of time by sending around hashes of your nonces so that you can ensure that people haven't changed them after they've seen your nonce. But this is a solvable problem. It's solved in the specs for both MuSig2 and FROST. And you just need to follow the spec when you implement it. It's just like writing a Bitcoin wallet.

I don't know what the right thing to do. The way this is described, your pkscripts are going to depend on this functionality... you could still use it without the aggregation. You could use the old checksig operator if you want. You could have an input that allows aggregation-compatible checksig, and that input is not made with an aggregate signature, you just provide the signature for it.

            "First, the search results from the first tool (search: bitcoin transaction validation consequences of mixed sighash flags) give several sources. The Bitcoin Wiki page on SIGHASH flags might have useful details. Then there's a BitcoinTalk thread discussing SIGHASH precedence in multisig. The Bitcoin StackExchange link talks about transaction malleability related to SIGHASH flags. The developer.bitcoin.org site might have technical details on transactions. The CertiK article mentions PSBT and security risks, which could be relevant. The arXiv paper about conflicting transactions might discuss impacts of mixing sighash flags.\n",

            "Also, the scrape failed for delvingbitcoin.org, so maybe I need to try different searches there. From the current memory, we still have the information gap in <ves-987> about concrete examples of mixing SIGHASH_ALL and SIGHASH_SINGLE impacts. Also, the search query 'security risks mixing SIGHASH_ALL SIGHASH_SINGLE' was needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at the tool results, the Bitcoin Wiki page (https://wiki.bitcoinsv.io/index.php/SIGHASH_flags) from Source 1 might explain different flags. The BitcoinTalk thread (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1383883.0) discusses SIGHASH precedence in multisig. That thread mentions that mixing SIGHASH flags can affect transaction validity if parts signed with different flags are altered. The StackExchange answer suggests that certain SIGHASH types interact in ways that could create malleability.\n",

Specifically, the Bitcoin Wiki page on SIGHASH flags, the BitcoinTalk thread on SIGHASH precedence, and possibly the CertiK article on PSBT security practices. However, the developer.bitcoin.org link might also have key info. Since the user wants info from Bitcoin-specific sites, prioritize scraping BitcoinWiki, BitcoinTalk, and the developer docs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the tool allows three scrapes per round, I should queue those URLs. So, first, check if the CertiK article mentions mixing sighash flags in PSBT usage. Alternatively, maybe the arXiv paper discusses conflicting transactions due to mixed flags. Wait, but arXiv link is about Impact of Conflicting Transactions, which could be related. However, arXiv isn't a Bitcoin-specific site, so perhaps left as a last resort.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the plan is to scrape the Bitcoin Wiki SIGHASH explanation, the BitcoinTalk thread, and the developer.bitcoin.org transactions page. Also, remember to update the memory with the new URLs found and their relevance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but in the current memory, there's a URL from CertiK (https://www.certik.com/...) which is about PSBT and security risks. Should that be scraped as well? The user's task is about mixing sighash flags, not PSBT specifically. But maybe the PSBT article discusses combining different sighash types. But maybe better to prioritize the direct sources first.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, adding the URLs from the search results (Bitcoin Wiki, BitcoinTalk, developer.bitcoin.org) to scrape next. Also, note that the initial scrape on Scaling Bitcoin didn't give relevant info, so maybe those transcripts are less useful here.\n",

            "\n",
            "After scraping those URLs, maybe the answer can be synthesized from the combined information. Key points might include:\n",

            "- Mixing SIGHASH flags allows partial signing but requires cautious handling to prevent transaction invalidation or malleability.\n",
            "- Differing SIGHASH flags in inputs determine which parts of the transaction are committed to by each input's signature.\n",
            "- If inputs are signed with different SIGHASH types, modifying parts of the transaction not covered by some signatures could invalidate those signatures.\n",
            "- Security risks include potential for transaction malleability if different SIGHASH flags allow certain modifications without invalidating all signatures.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, need to check if there are examples or specific implications detailed in the scraped pages. For instance, using SIGHASH_ALL (which signs all inputs and outputs) vs SIGHASH_SINGLE (which signs only the corresponding output) in different inputs could lead to scenarios where some inputs are not committed to all parts, allowing changes in other parts without invalidating their signatures.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, based on the retrieved tool results, let's note findings:\n",
            "\n",
            "From the BitcoinTalk thread (topic 1383883.0), user mentioned that if one party signs with SIGHASH_ALL and another uses a different flag, changing parts of the transaction could invalidate only some signatures. For example, adding an output might not invalidate the SIGHASH_SINGLE signature if it's not modifying the output they signed. This could lead to scenarios where the transaction remains valid even after modifications, leading to malleability.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Bitcoin Wiki on SIGHASH flags explains each flag's scope. Mixing flags would mean different inputs are protecting different parts of the transaction. This can complicate the security model, as not all inputs are secured against the same modifications.\n",
            "\n",
            "The developer.bitcoin.org page on transactions might detail how the flags are processed during validation. For example, each input's scriptSig contains the sighash type, and the node checks each signature against the portion of the transaction specified by its sighash.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the CertiK article, maybe improper use of PSBT with mixed sighash types could lead to vulnerabilities. But since the scrape wasn't done yet, not confirmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, the arXiv paper on conflicting transactions suggests that differing sighash flags could lead to different versions of a transaction being valid, enabling certain attacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, pending scrapes need to be executed to get more concrete details. Updating the memory to note these URLs and track gathered info.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, need to delete the previous pending scrape of Scaling Bitcoin because it didn't yield relevant info (<ptp-998>). Then, add the new URLs from the search results as memory blocks for scraping.\n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the next steps are:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Scrape the BitcoinTalk thread (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1383883.0)\n",

            "\n",
            "But wait, the BitcoinSV Wiki is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision's wiki, which might not be the same as Bitcoin Core's approach. However, perhaps the explanation of SIGHASH flags is compatible since the basic concepts are similar. However, since the user wants Bitcoin-specific sources, and BitcoinSV is a fork, maybe relying on it isn't ideal. But since there might be no other sources, perhaps it's acceptable as a technical reference.\n",
            "\n",
            "The 'Privacy' page from en.bitcoin.it (Bitcoin Wiki Core) could be another source, but the search result didn't return a valid URL for that. Alternatively, need to check if there's a way to get the correct Bitcoin Core Wiki page.\n",

            "\n",
            "Now, the JSON response should include operations to add the new URLs to scrape, delete the existing pending URL that wasn't helpful, and possibly use the next three tool calls to scrape those three new URLs. Then, once those are scraped, the info can be synthesized.\n",
            "\n",
            "But given tool limitations (maximum 3 calls per round), in the next step, the tool calls would be three scrapes: BitcoinTalk thread, BitcoinSV Wiki SIGHASH flags, and developer.bitcoin.org transaction page.

The current workspace has some memory blocks with URLs and information gaps. The tool results from scraping Bitcointalk, Bitcoinsv Wiki, and Bitcoin Developer Guide need to be analyzed first.\n",
            "\n",
            "From Source 1 (Bitcointalk scrape), there's a discussion where developers mention that each signature in a transaction input uses its own sighash type. If different sighash flags are mixed in the same input (like one sig using SIGHASH_ALL and another SIGHASH_SINGLE), each signature must be validated against the transaction data according to its respective flag. There's a mention of transaction atomicity, meaning all inputs must validate regardless of their sighash types. However, mixing flags could lead to unexpected behaviors if not properly handled, and there's a warning from gmaxwell about potential misunderstandings if code assumes a single sighash per input.\n",
            "\n",
            "Source 2 (Bitcoinsv Wiki) explains different sighash flags and combinations, noting that BitcoinSV adds SIGHASH_FORKID. It details what parts of the transaction are signed with each flag. However, this might be specific to BitcoinSV, which is a fork, so the information might not apply directly to Bitcoin Core. Still, the general principles of how each flag affects what is signed could be relevant.\n",
            "\n",
            "Source 3 (Bitcoin Developer Guide) covers basic sighash types: ALL, NONE, SINGLE, and their combinations with ANYONECANPAY. It mentions that the signature hash type signs the locktime and that SIGHASH_ALL protects all inputs and outputs except the signature scripts. It also talks about transaction malleability, which isn't protected by most sighash types.\n",
            "\n",
            "Existing memory blocks have an info gap (ves-987) about concrete examples of mixing ALL and SINGLE. The scraped info from Bitcointalk addresses that by showing that mixing leads to each signature being validated individually. Another point is from amaclin, stating the transaction is atomic, so all inputs must pass validation even with different sighash types.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the key findings are:\n",
            "- Each input's signatures are validated separately according to their own sighash flags.\n",
            "- Mixing flags in multi-sig inputs requires each signer to sign according to their specified flag, which might lead to partial signing of transaction data.\n",
            "- Possibility of unexpected vulnerabilities or network splits if nodes handle mixed sighash differently, but the Bitcoin Core code enforces that each signature is checked against its flag's rules.\n",
            "- Transactions remain atomic; all inputs must validate with their respective flags.\n",
            "\n",
            "But there might be remaining info gaps. For example, are there practical examples or documented attacks from mixing flags? The existing sources don't provide that. The memory also has a link to mnm-596 (Bitcoin Developer Guide) which was scraped but maybe not fully utilized. The Developer Guide mentions malleability issues but not mixing flags directly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Possible next steps: Check if the scraped Bitcoin Developer Guide content (source 3) mentions mixing flags. It does mention different types but mainly SIGHASH_ALL/NONE/SINGLE and their combinations. The key point is that SIGHASH_ALL is the default, protecting all inputs and outputs. So if an input uses ALL and another uses NONE, the NONE input allows outputs to be modified. However, since the transaction is atomic, modifying outputs would invalidate the ALL signature. This creates a conflict. Therefore, mixing flags could create constraints on how the transaction can be modified.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, but according to the BitcoinTalk discussion, each signature's sighash is processed individually. So if one input is signed with NONE (allowing output changes) and another with ALL (locking outputs), modifying the outputs would invalidating the ALL-signing input's signature. Therefore, such a transaction couldn't be modified without breaking the ALL signature. So effectively, mixing ALL with other flags in different inputs might lead to the strictest rules applying (since changing anything protected by ALL would invalidate that signature), but if multiple inputs have varying flags, it's unclear how modifications would work.\n",
            "\n",
            "The problem comes when different inputs have conflicting requirements. For example, if Input 1 uses SIGHASH_ALL (locking all outputs) and Input 2 uses SIGHASH_NONE (allowing output changes). But changing outputs would invalidate Input 1's signature. Hence, the transaction can't legally be modified once both inputs are signed. Therefore, mixing flags across inputs may restrict malleability, requiring that any modification must not violate any of the sighash constraints of any input.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another scenario: multiple signatures in the same input using different flags. According to gmaxwell in the Bitcointalk thread, each signature in an input uses its own sighash. For a 2-of-2 multisig input where one sig uses ALL and the other uses SINGLE, the transaction would need to be compatible with both sighash types when validated. But since each signature commits to different parts of the transaction, it's possible only for a specific transaction structure where both conditions are satisfied.\n",
            "\n",
            "So when you mix flags, the transaction must satisfy all the constraints imposed by each signature's sighash. This might limit the flexibility of modifying the transaction after it's signed or require careful coordination between signers to ensure compatibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "Security implications include potential for unintended transaction malleability if not all sighash implications are considered. For instance, if an input uses SIGHASH_NONE, an attacker could add outputs, but if another input uses SIGHASH_ALL, that would prevent such modifications unless coordinated.\n",
            "\n",
            "The answer needs to consolidate these points: each signature's sighash is processed individually, validation requires all signatures to be valid under their flags, potential for conflicts or constraints in transaction structure, and security implications related to malleability and modification.\n",
            "\n",
            "Are there remaining info gaps? The initial memory block ves-987 wanted concrete examples. The scraped sources provide some examples in discussion but maybe not code-level. Perhaps checking the MPCbros vs TeamScript debate (hua-860) would help, but it's already in the memory as a URL to explore. However, since the tool calls already used scrape on three URLs, maybe another round could scrape https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2017-09/2017-09-06-signature-aggregation (wzd-186) which is about signature aggregation and might discuss sighash interaction. Alternatively, search for specific mentions of mixing flags in other sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "But given the tool results we have, the answer can be constructed as follows:\n",
            "\n",
            "Mixing sighash flags in a Bitcoin transaction means that each signature is validated according to its specified sighash type. When different flags like SIGHASH_ALL and SIGHASH_SINGLE are used across inputs or within the same multisig input, each signature commits to different parts of the transaction data. This can lead to complex validation requirements where the transaction must satisfy all conditions imposed by each sighash flag used. For example, a transaction with one input using SIGHASH_ALL (locking all inputs and outputs) and another using SIGHASH_SINGLE (locking only the corresponding output) requires that any modification to non-locked parts must not affect the parts committed by any signature. This interplay can restrict transaction malleability, introduce potential security risks if not handled correctly, and necessitates rigorous validation to prevent consensus issues. Additionally, using SIGHASH flags like NONE or ANYONECANPAY with others might allow partial modifications, but conflicting flags could make the transaction invalid if changes violate any sighash constraints.\n",

            "Okay, let's start by reviewing the task and the information gathered so far. The user wants to know about the \"clear stack rule\" in Bitcoin, and I need to use only Bitcoin-specific websites. My initial searches on bitcoinops.org, btctranscripts.com, and delvingbitcoin.org have returned various results that I need to sift through.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, looking at the search results from bitcoinops.org. The term \"clear stack rule\" doesn't directly appear in the titles or descriptions here. The newsletters and podcasts mostly discuss other topics like Taproot, transaction fees, and opcodes like OP_CHECKOUTPUTSHASHVERIFY. Not much directly relevant here, though maybe the transaction relay policies could touch on stack rules, but I don't see a direct link. I'll note that these sources didn't yield info on the clear stack rule. Maybe need to check other sites.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, the btctranscripts.com search. There's a mention in the \"Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees\" transcript: \"cleanstack is a consensus rule ... except for SegWit.\" Wait, \"cleanstack\" sounds similar to \"clear stack rule.\" That could be it. The text says that with SegWit, the cleanstack rule was modified. So perhaps \"clear stack rule\" is another term for \"cleanstack rule\" in Bitcoin Script. That's a key insight. I should store that as a finding.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, in the Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees source, it explains that normally, when a script execution ends, the stack must have exactly one element (true) to be valid. The cleanstack rule ensures that after execution, only the top element (the result) remains. SegWit versions (v0 and above) no longer require this because they moved the witness data outside the spending transaction's input, thus modifying how the consensus rules apply. This seems central to understanding the clean stack rule. I need to capture this info into a memory block, referencing the btctranscripts.com source.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at the delvingbitcoin.org results, there's a discussion about the Great Consensus Cleanup, which might relate to rule changes. However, the specific mention of cleanstack doesn't appear in the provided results. The Draft BIP for OP_TXHASH and OP_CHECKTXHASHVERIFY doesn't seem directly related. So perhaps the main source comes from btctranscripts.com.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, considering the user's question and needing to answer comprehensively, I need to confirm if \"clear stack rule\" refers to the \"cleanstack\" rule. Since cleanstack is a known term in Bitcoin Script for the requirement that the stack must be clean (only one TRUE value left) after script execution, except in SegWit contexts, it's plausible that \"clear stack\" is another way to refer to this. The btctranscripts.com entry clarifies this.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that the search on btctranscripts.com provided the necessary info, and no other sources contradicted or added to this, I can proceed to form the answer based on that. The answer needs to explain what the clean stack rule is, its purpose (ensuring the stack is clean post-execution), and how SegWit changed its application for witness scripts. Since SegWit v0 and later versions moved the witness data, perhaps the cleanstack rule isn't enforced there, allowing multiple stack elements if necessary, but preserving the main consensus rule for non-SegWit scripts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, checking if there are any other mentions. The \"Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees\" discussion also mentions termination conditions where multiple stack items might violate the cleanstack rule unless in SegWit contexts. This reinforces the idea that the cleanstack rule is a consensus rule enforcing a single element on the stack after execution unless under specific conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, the answer would outline that the clear stack (cleanstack) rule is a consensus rule in Bitcoin that requires the script execution to end with exactly one TRUE value on the stack.
